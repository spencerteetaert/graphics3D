# Graphics3D
Graphics3D is an attempt that I made to explore the math behind graphics. It makes use of trig to give the sense of a 3D workspace. Along with the pure graphics I've added a user experience that makes the program into a building sandbox. The user can add, delete, and move blocks as they please.
